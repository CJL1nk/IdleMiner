THIS ONLY APPLIES IF YOU HAVE A PREVIOUS VERSION INSTALLED:

Open data.json
Add a comma after the number in pickaxeSpeedCost, the line should then look like   "pickaxeSpeedCost": 5000000000,
Add a line below with the following content:    "multiplier": 1.0

basically you're adding a multiplier key
